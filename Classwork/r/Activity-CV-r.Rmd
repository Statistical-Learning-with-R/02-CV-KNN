## Code from slides

```{r, message = FALSE}
ins <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/bocjjyo1ehr5auz/insurance_costs_1.csv?dl=1")
head(ins)
```

```{r}
lr_mod <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")
```




```{r}
ins_cvs <- vfold_cv(ins, v = 10)

poly_1_cv <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(charges ~ bmi,
                resamples = ins_cvs)

poly_2_cv <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(charges ~ poly(bmi, 2),
                resamples = ins_cvs)
```

```{r}
poly_1_cv %>% collect_metrics()

poly_2_cv %>% collect_metrics()
```

## Your turn

Suppose you want to fit a regression that predicts `charges` from `age` and `bmi`.

Consider four models:

* `age` and `bmi` both have polynomial 1
* `age` has polynomial 1, `bmi` has polynomial 2
* `age` has polynomial 2, `bmi` has polynomial 1
* `age` and `bmi` both have polynomial 2

(No interactions term for any model.)

Which model is best according to a **Cross-Validation study** with 10 splits?
